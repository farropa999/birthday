            <h2>About You</h2>
            <p>Where to start yaar? i hardly used to talk to you, never knew how you are as a person and tbh
                for me you were just a colleague whose there working with us, but slowly slowly we started talking a little bit
                regarding orders and stuff, but still it didnt change anything, as time started passing it was getting a little better for me to talk to you,
                but still awkward, i felt something not hugely but something was different during Mohammed Ali Road meet, idk what was it but i felt something different,
                we were talking with each other while searching for the cab, pata nhi acha lag raha tha kuch toh, aur phir dheere dheere humrari baatein start hui,
                kuch situations aisi create hui jaha hum saathme lunch karne lage, saathme jaane lage, ek seat pe baithte bhi nhi the bus me, everything was fine, i didn't think anything,
                but phir aap 1 week ke liye Pune gaye, idk but i was not liking anything sabkuch ajeebsa lag raha tha, Ayan tha baaki ke log the but still it felt incomplete, mein boht confused the
                why what kyu ho raha hai aise, isiliye bichme kabhi randomly ekada message karta tha i was not hoping to get reply but i got and i used to feel good, but i still had no clue
                why its like that, ek baar aise aata tha dimaag me do i like her? but instantly hota tha nhi yaar yeh kya soch raha hu mein, but then things started changing i started noticing you
                aap sahi khaa rahe ho yaa nhi aapki tabyat sahi hai yaa nahi, aapka mood uppset hai kya, i started noticing and started to care about all of that and i wanted to ix everything
                meine kitni baar try kiya khudko control karne ka ki i cannot have feelings for you hum dono me kaafi difference hai personal, financial mujhe yeh bhi nhi pata tha if you are commited to
                someone or no, but i couldn't resist but come closer and closer to you, aur phir humari baateinf start hui actually me pata nhi kaise boht he unexpected tha vo, but we started talking till around 1am slowly vo time badhta gaya
                and i fell for you full on, uske baad aisa hua ki i accepted that i like you i do feel something special for you
                aapki baatein, aapki aadatein, aapka masti karna, aapka nakhre dikhana sab kuch acha lagne laga alag sa feel hota tha acha feel hota tha
                i started liking you as a person, we started getting closer and closer, vo raat raat ka baatein karna subah utho toh sabse pehle phone check karna
                yaa toh aapka message padhliya yaa toh aapki aawaz sunke apna din start karta tha, kaam pe jaane me itna excited kabhi nhi hua tha jitna tab hota tha, liked every second spent with you it was all worthy, and all those
                memories have created a permenant place in my mind just like how you have created in my heart Pradnya, mujhe aur boht kuch likhna hai but aap so jaaoge mein baadme uodate karunga isse!</p>
